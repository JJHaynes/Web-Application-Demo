// In future I can refactor this to a DB:
const FaqInformation = [
  { question: 'How do I join?', answer: 'After signing up, go to your dashboard and click join. Follow the guided steps to configure your setup.' },
  { question: 'Is my data secure?', answer: 'We use industry-standard encryption and secure compliance measures to protect your participants\' information.' },
  { question: 'What are the fees?', answer: 'We charge a small percentage of ticket sales to cover hosting and compliance, with no upfront costs for charities.' },
]
